<!-- Set background image of the app, the photo of the slot machine
 
Create a variable for each image that defines the value of the images 

Set a variable of scoring sequences, with a different value for each combination of images

Set all 3 initial rell DIV cells to null

Create  a function called “play” that is an event listener, when pressed generates a random number on all the divs using the math.floor(math.random) method

That number correlates to the weighted numbers variable that correlates to the item array

If the three images in the tables are a match, you receive a “X” number of points on the scoreboard,(depending on value) UNLESS it is the joker card, which you lose “X” number of points

If the three randomized images are not a match, no points are added but 10 points are removed from the scoreboard

Update points gained or lost based on the values of the combination of cards on the display at the top of the app on the scoreboard


Create an init function that initializes the board and resets all the div's values to null, and resets the scoreboard to 0.

In the game's DOM remember the highest score ever obtained in the scoreboard function -->
